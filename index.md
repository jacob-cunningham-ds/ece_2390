## Summary of course

This course introduces concepts of image processing including image filtering and enhancement, segmentation techniques, feature extraction, and object recognition and tracking. Material will be presented in a series of lectures and through examples in Python notebooks. OpenCV, Python, and GitHub will be used for most lectures and homework assignments. By the end of the course you should be able to:

- Apply spatial and frequency domain filtering methods to images and video feeds
- Apply image registration and alignment methods (including applications in digital photography)
- Understand and apply feature and edge-based segmentation tools
- Use OpenCV to extract and recognize text, objects, and people
- Ability to develop and use shared modular Python libraries within GitHub

## GitHub

The homework will be done via GitHub Classroom. All lectures and demo code can be found at: <https://github.com/SSOE-ECE1390>

## Textbook

There is no required textbook for this course. Lecture materials will be posted online (Canvas) prior to each lecture. Python Notebooks presented in class will be available on the course's GitHub page.

## Grading scale

- Classwork
    - 40% of grade
    - Practical examples done in Python/OpenCV
    - Done mostly in class in small groups. If not finished, then homework
- Semester project
    - 20% final
    - 20% peer-ratings
    - 20% in class

Scores are calculated as shown in [Table (%s)](#table-score-calculation) and your grades are assigned as shown in [Table(%s)](#table-grade-assignment).

## Homework details

There will be 12 homework assignments given. Each assignment will be worth 10 points. Homework will be done via Canvas and GitHub Classroom and will be mostly done in class (if you don't finish in class, you will have to do it as homework). All homework will consists of problems to be worked out in Python Notebooks and/or Python libraries. These will be based on the material presented in lectures, but usually bring in a slightly different algorithm or look at how function parameters change the output from what was presented in class.

## Semester project

The semester project will put together methods learned over the course into a program to process images. Students in 1390 will implement these tools for static images. Students in 2390 will also have to implement video processing in their project.

## Code sharing

Since computer programmers are part of a great community which provides countless tutorials, help forums, open-source code, and AI-based coding help, we will embrace this as part of the course. Any resource can be used to do the homework and semester project provided that the following practices are used:
- Python libraries and notebooks should be well documented
    - <https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/>
    - <https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html>
    - <https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/best_practices.html>
- List of any dependencies for the code
- Methods and Classes should document their purpose, inputs, and/or outputs
- Use meaningful and consistent names for variables
- Borrowed/adapted/inspired code is properly credited
    - Cite the source for any code borrowed from somewhere else
    - Must comply with rules of license for borrowed code (e.g., an MIT license requires preservation of copyright and license notices in any child code)

As part of the semester project, you will need to implement both code from libraries you have developed (as part of the homework sets) and code from other classmates. Therefore, it is important that you document properly how to use your code.
