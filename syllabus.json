We begin with Image Segmentation, covering fundamental techniques such as region-based methods, edge detection, scale space, and active contours, to understand how to partition an image into meaningful segments. Moving forward, we delve into Shape Representation and Matching, where we explore shape description techniques and deformable templates, enabling us to represent and compare complex shapes effectively.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"IlwICQbg6T"}],"key":"t4tKD7MgwK"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The course also includes a detailed study of Texture Analysis and Labeling, focusing on the analysis of textures and consistent labeling methods to categorize different regions of an image based on their textural properties.
