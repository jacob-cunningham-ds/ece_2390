This course provides an in-depth exploration of essential concepts in image processing and computer vision, structured around key areas of the field. We begin with Image Segmentation, covering fundamental techniques such as region-based methods, edge detection, scale space, and active contours, to understand how to partition an image into meaningful segments. Moving forward, we delve into Shape Representation and Matching, where we explore shape description techniques and deformable templates, enabling us to represent and compare complex shapes effectively.

The course also includes a detailed study of Texture Analysis and Labeling, focusing on the analysis of textures and consistent labeling methods to categorize different regions of an image based on their textural properties. In the segment on Camera Models, we examine the perspective camera model and its parameters, providing a foundation for understanding how images are formed and how to model the imaging process.

We then transition to the Geometry of Multiple Views, covering topics such as the geometry of two views, the fundamental matrix, and scene planes and homographies. These concepts are crucial for understanding the relationships between different views of a scene and for applications like 3D reconstruction and motion analysis.

Finally, the course addresses Object Localization and Motion Analysis, focusing on techniques to locate objects in three-dimensional space and analyze their motion over time. Through these comprehensive topics, students will gain a robust understanding of the key principles and techniques in image processing and computer vision, preparing them for advanced study or professional practice in the field.
